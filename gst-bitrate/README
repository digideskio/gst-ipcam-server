WHAT IT IS
----------

GstBitRate is a small gstreamer(http://gstreamer.net/) plugin to allow user adjust
video encoding bitrate at runtime.

-------------

Just like normal gstreamer element.

To build:
    $ cd gst-bitrate
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

The plugin element's name is bitrate.
Bitrate element has 2 properties:
