This is a brief instruction guide to fetch, build and test gst-ipcam-server servers on Ubuntu 9.04.

I. FETCH SOURCE CODE
 - Create a new folder on your hard disk to store source code.
 - Go to that folder and fetch the code with this command:
	$ git clone git://github.com/trungnt/gst-ipcam-server.git
   After finishing this command, a sub-folder named "gst-ipcam-server" will be created with our source code inside.
 - Go to gst-ipcam-server folder:
	$ cd gst-ipcam-server
 - To test a given release - for example, release XXX - use this command:
	$ git reset --hard XXX
 - To work with the development version, use the following command:
   	$ git checkout --track -b server-development origin/server-development
 - Notes: If the development branch was already fetched, no need to fetch it again. Instead, switch to the branch by the commands:
	$ git checkout server-development 	# to switch to an existing server-development branch.
	$ git pull 				# to update to the latest revision.

II. BUILD
 - NOTE: before building the server, go to section IV to check whether all necessary packages are present in your system.
 - Go to the folder "server".
 - For the first time build, run:
   	$ ./autogen.sh
 - Build :
   	$ make

III. Fps Plugin
  From release 0.4, server comes with fps plugin to adjust framerate at runtime.

1. Fetch Source Code
  Fps plugin can be installed indepedence with the server but here. But here, it comes with server source code. No need to do any extra work.

2. Build
 - Inside gst-ipcam-server folder, change to gst-fps folder:
	$ cd gst-fps
 - Then:
	$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr
	$ make
	$ sudo make install

3. Usage
 - Fps plugin is a gstreamer plugin. Use it like other ones.
 - The plugin element's name is fpsbin.
 - fpsbin element has one property: framerate - value of frame rate to set to.

IV. SOFTWARE DEPENDENCIES
1. Standard Gstreamers packages from Ubuntu 9.04 repository:
- Run the following command:
	$ sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad and gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse

If you can not run the command, enable "Communiti-maintained Open Source software (universe)" and "Software restricted by copyright or legal issues (multiverse)" by following below steps:
	+ From the main menu, select "System".
	+ Select "Adminitrastion".
	+ Select "Software Sources"
	+ Check "Communiti-maintained Open Source software (universe)" and "Software restricted by copyright or legal issues (multiverse)".
	+ Click "Close" button.
	+ Then click "Reload" on popup dialog or run "sudo apt-get update" in the terminal.
	+ After that, you can use install command as above.

1. Gstreamers version >= 0.10.24.1, from ppa repository:  
- Add following lines to /etc/apt/sources.list:  
	deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/gstreamer-developers/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main  
	deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/gstreamer-developers/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main  
 
- Then:  
	$ sudo apt-get update  
	$ sudo apt-get install libgstreamer0.10-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg
 
3. Build tools, if not installed yet:  
	$ sudo apt-get install autoconf automake pkg-config libtool build-essential gettext libglib2.0-dev 

V. RUN
   We have 3 servers for H264, JPEG and MPEG4 inside "servers" directory with names: 
    - onesrc-h264 (url: rtsp://ip:8554/h264)
    - onesrc-jpeg (url: rtsp://ip:8554/jpg)
    - onesrc-mpeg4 (url: rtsp://ip:8554/mpeg4)
   For H264 and MPEG4 servers, we have 3 options for audio include: AAC, G726 and G711 format. Use them is easy, with the following usage:
    $ server [None/aac/g726/g711]
   With None for using server without audio.
