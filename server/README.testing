This is a brief instruction guide to fetch, build and test gst-ipcam-server servers on Ubuntu 9.04.

I. FETCH SOURCE CODE
 - Create a new folder on your hard disk to store source code.
 - Go to that folder and fetch the code with this command:
  	$ git clone git://github.com/trungnt/gst-ipcam-server.git
   After finishing this command, a sub-folder named "gst-ipcam-server" will be created with our source code inside.
 - Go to gst-ipcam-server folder:
	$ cd gst-ipcam-server
 - To work with the development version, use the following command:
   	$ git checkout --track -b server-development origin/server-development
 - Notes: If the development branch was already fetched, no need to fetch it again. Instead, switch to the branch by the commands:
	$ git checkout server-development 	# to switch to an existing server-development branch.
	$ git pull 				# to update to the latest revision.

II. BUILD
 - NOTE: before building the server, go to section III to check whether all necessary packages are present in your system.
 - Go to the folder "server".
 - For the first time build, run:
   	$ ./autogen.sh
 - Build :
   	$ make

III. SOFTWARE DEPENDENCIES
1. Gstreamers version >= 0.10.24.1, from ppa repository:  
- Add following lines to /etc/apt/sources.list:  
	deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/gstreamer-developers/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main  
	deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/gstreamer-developers/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main  
 
- Then:  
	$ sudo apt-get update  
	$ sudo apt-get install libgstreamer0.10-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev  
 
2. MPEG4 and H.264 encoders from FFMPEG  
 + gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg version 0.10.6.2-1ubuntu2 (standard package with Ubuntu 9.04, ppa package may not work).
 + libavcodec-unstripped-52.
 	$ sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg libavcodec-unstripped-52  
 
- After installation, gst-inspect may not find ffenc_mpeg4 and ffenc_libx264. This case often happens if gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg was installed with libavcodec package (which does not include MPEG4 and H.264 encoders). To fix, remove old gstreamer plugin registry files by issuing:  
	$ rm ~/.gstreamer-0.10/registry.*  
 
3. Build tools, if not installed yet:  
	$ sudo apt-get install autoconf automake pkg-config libtool build-essential gettext libglib2.0-dev 

IV. RUN
   We have 3 servers for H264, JPEG and MPEG4 inside "servers" directory with names: 
    - onesrc-h264 (url: rtsp://ip:8554/h264)
    - onesrc-jpeg (url: rtsp://ip:8554/jpg)
    - onesrc-mpeg4 (url: rtsp://ip:8554/mpeg4)
   For H264 and MPEG4 servers, we have 3 options for audio include: AAC, G726 and G711 format. Use them is easy, with the following usage:
    $ server [None/aac/g726/g711]
   With None for using server without audio.
