WHAT IT IS
----------

GstFpsBin is a small gstreamer(http://gstreamer.net/) plugin to allow user adjust
video frame rate runtime.

HOW TO USE IT
-------------

Just like normal gstreamer element.

To build:
    $cd gst-fps
    $./autogen.sh
    $make
    $sudo make install

To test the plugin, use a pipeline like this
    $gst-launch videotestsrc ! fpsbin framerate='5/1' ! autovideosink

This will limit the frame rate to 5 (fps)
