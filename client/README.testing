This is a brief instruction guide to fetch, build and test gst-ipcam-client on Ubuntu 9.04.

I. FETCH SOURCE CODE
 - Create a new folder on your hard disk to store source code.
 - Go to that folder and fetch the code with this command:
  	$ git clone git://github.com/trungnt/gst-ipcam-server.git
   After finishing this command, a sub-folder named "gst-ipcam-server" will be created with our source code inside.
 - Go to gst-ipcam-server folder:
	$ cd gst-ipcam-server
 - To work with the development version, use the following command:
   	$ git checkout --track -b client-development origin/client-development
 - Notes: If the development branch was already fetched, no need to fetch it again. Instead, switch to the branch by the commands:
	$ git checkout client-development 	# to switch to existing client-development branch.
	$ git pull 				# to update to the latest revision.
 
II. BUILD
 - NOTE: before building the client, go to section III to check whether all necessary packages are present in your system.
 - Go to the folder "client".
 - Build the package:
	$ make

III. SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
1. Basic gstreamer packages
 - Run following command to install required basic gstreamer packages:
	$ sudo apt-get install libgstreamer0.10-dev gstreamer0.10-plugins-base gstreamer0.10-plugins-good gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad

2. MPEG4 and H.264 encoders from FFMPEG  
 + gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg version 0.10.6.2-1ubuntu2 (standard package with Ubuntu 9.04, ppa package may not work).
 + libavcodec-unstripped-52.
 	$ sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg libavcodec-unstripped-52  
 
- After installation, gst-inspect may not find ffenc_mpeg4 and ffenc_libx264. This case often happens if gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg was installed with libavcodec package (which does not include MPEG4 and H.264 encoders). To fix, remove old gstreamer plugin registry files by issuing:  
	$ rm ~/.gstreamer-0.10/registry.*
 
3. Build tools, if not installed yet:  
    $ sudo apt-get install autoconf automake pkg-config libtool build-essential gettext libglib2.0-dev libgtk2.0-dev

IV. RUN
 - run command:
   	$ ./gst-ipcam-client
 - Usage: the client is simple, investigate and try it yourself.
