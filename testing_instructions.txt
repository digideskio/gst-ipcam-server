=========================================================================
This section is about hardware requirements necessary to run gst-ipcam-server servers.

A.I. Webcam (image source)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The servers are tested to work well with Logitech Quickcam E3500 Plus as image source but should work with any UVC Webcam compatible with v4l2 driver.

Before trying gst-ipcam-server, it is advised to make sure first the Webcam to be used works correctly with your Ubuntu. Follow these steps:
 - Connect the Webcam to your PC.
 - Check it works with gstreamer:
	$ gst-launch v4l2src ! autovideosink
   If everything is fine, a screen showing live images captured by the Webcam will display.

NOTES: In order to test servers with 2 source cameras, the PC must have 2 USB connectors available and each Webcam must be connected to a different USB connector.

A.II. Microphone (audio source)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The servers are tested to work well with the microphone bundled with Logitech Quickcam E3500 Plus.

By default, Ubuntu Jaunty 9.04 comes with a sound recorder program which can be used to test the microphone.
 - In the gnome menu, select "Applications" -> "Sound & Video" -> "Sound Recorder".
 - In the Sound Recorder toolbar, click "Record". In the bottom of it's window, you will see a label "Recording ..." and a progress bar with label "Level:".
 - Make some noise or talk to the microphone, the "Level:" progress bar shows some movements when the program recognizes different sound levels, meaning that the microphone works.
 - You can click "Stop" and then "Play" to hear what has been recorded.

=========================================================================

B.I. SERVER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

B.I.1. Fetch Source Code
 - Create a new folder on your hard disk to store source code.
 - Go to that folder and fetch the code with this command:
	$ git clone git://github.com/trungnt/gst-ipcam-server.git
   After finishing this command, a sub-folder named "gst-ipcam-server" will be created with our source code inside.
 - Go to gst-ipcam-server folder:
	$ cd gst-ipcam-server
 - To test a given release XXX, use these commands:
	$ git fetch --tags			# to make sure all tags are fetched and updated
	then
	$ git reset --hard XXX
  For example, to work with release 0.1:
	$ git reset --hard 0.1
 - To work with the development version of the servers, use the following command:
   	$ git checkout --track -b server-development origin/server-development
 - Notes: If the development branch was already fetched, no need to fetch it again. Instead, switch to the branch by the commands:
	$ git checkout server-development 	# to switch to an existing server-development branch.
	$ git pull 				# to update to the latest revision.

B.I.2. Build
 - NOTE: before building the server, go to section B.I.3. to check whether all necessary packages are present in your system.
 - Go to the folder "server"
 - For the first time build, run:
   	$ ./autogen.sh
 - Build :
   	$ make

B.I.3. Software Dependencies
B.I.3.a. Standard Gstreamers packages from Ubuntu 9.04 repository:
- Run the following command:
	$ sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad and gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse

If apt-get doesn't found mentioned packages, enable "Community-maintained Open Source software (universe)" and "Software restricted by copyright or legal issues (multiverse)" as following:
	+ From the main Ubuntu menu, select "System".
	+ Select "Adminitrastion".
	+ Select "Software Sources"
	+ Check "Community-maintained Open Source software (universe)" and "Software restricted by copyright or legal issues (multiverse)".
	+ Click "Close" button.
	+ Then click "Reload" on popup dialog or run "sudo apt-get update" in the terminal.
	+ Once done, you should be able to install necessary packages by re-running the above command.

B.I.3.b. Gstreamer version >= 0.10.24.1, from ppa repository:
- Add following lines to /etc/apt/sources.list (you will need sudo rights):
	deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/gstreamer-developers/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main
	deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/gstreamer-developers/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main

- Then:
	$ sudo apt-get update
	$ sudo apt-get install libgstreamer0.10-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg gstreamer0.10-plugins-good gstreamer0.10-plugins-base

B.I.3.c. Build tools, if not installed yet:
	$ sudo apt-get install autoconf automake pkg-config libtool build-essential gettext libglib2.0-dev

B.I.4. Run
  We have 9 different servers inside "servers" directory, named as follows:
	- onesrc-h264: server supporting only H264 streams (one source camera).
	- onesrc-jpeg: server supporting only JPEG streams (one source camera).
	- onesrc-mpeg4: server supporting only MPEG4 streams (one source camera).
	- onesrc-jpeg-h264: server supporting JPEG and H264 streams from one source camera.
	- onesrc-jpeg-mpeg4: server supporting JPEG and MPEG4 streams from one source camera.
	- onesrc-h264-mpeg4: server supporting H264 and MPEG4 streams from one source camera.
	- twosrc-jpeg-h264: server supporting JPEG and H264 streams from 2 source cameras.
	- twosrc-jpeg-mpeg4: server supporting JPEG and MPEG4 streams from 2 source cameras.
	- twosrc-h264-mpeg4: server supporting H264 and MPEG4 streams from 2 source cameras.

  The urls for requesting streams are:
	- rtsp://ip:8554/h264 for h264 stream.
	- rtsp://ip:8554/jpg for JPEG stream.
	- rtsp://ip:8554/mpeg4 for MPEG4 stream.
  Where ip is the IP address of the server.

  H264 and MPEG4 support 3 audio formats: AAC, G711 and G726. To enable audio in these stream, launch the servers with audio format as parameter as following:
	$ server_name audio_format
	Where:
	  + server_name is any server support H264 and/or MPEG4 stream(s).
	  + audio_format can be: aac (for AAC), g711 (for G711) and g726 (for G726). This parameter is case-sensitive.
	For example:
	To start MPEG4 server with AAC audio, run:
		$ ./onesrc-mpeg4 aac

B.I.5. Fps Plugin
  Starting from release 0.4, servers come with fps plugin to enable adjusting stream framerate at runtime.

B.I.5.a. Fetch Source Code
  As a note, fps plugin can be installed indepedently from the servers although it is being delivered here together with servers.

B.I.5.b. Build
 - From inside gst-ipcam-server folder, change to gst-fps folder:
	$ cd gst-fps
 - Then:
	$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr
